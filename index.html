  <h2 id="about">ABOUT</h2>
<p>An embedded firmware engineer with a passion towards technology, a thirst for knowledge and a strive to create better products for world welfare. As a Firmware engineer, I started my career with projects based on Yocto BSPs, device driver and V4L2-based applications development. On the go, I narrowed down my area of interest to Linux driver development, multimedia HW and related applications, where I ended up working on challenging and interesting solutions like custom image sensors (FB, TOF, EB) bring up, multimedia pipeline design, image quality analysis and tuning, developing vision-based solutions for automotive, rescue devices, and entertainment, and designing features to provide customized products and solutions. I have also actively worked on enabling the mobile camera and vision-based Custom hardware and software vendors to develop and productize their solutions cumulatively adding up to 4 years of customer handling experience.</p>
